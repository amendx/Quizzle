# Quizzle Project
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.

## To start (if not set up yet) 
In this project, I'm using two framworks: 
* Angular 6
* NodeJS 

First you'll need to have `NodeJS` installed, if you already have it, skip this step.

You can download it from here: 
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```
After your download and install NodeJS, please, clone this repository and run `npm install` to install all of its dependencies.  
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.



## Run The DB Server
To run its database, you'll have to run it locally, please use this command line on a different terminal:
`json-server --watch db.json`



## How to Start

* You can register, but it's not usefull if you're running it locally.
